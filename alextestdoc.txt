9. DATA DESCRIPTION
  The ninth attempt was run as follows: ./soda

  CONFIG FILE:
  	SodaCost                2    # Manufacturer Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) per bottle
	NumStudents             2    # number of students to create
	MaxPurchases            8    # maximum number of bottles a student purchases
	NumVendingMachines      3    # number of vending machines
	MaxStockPerFlavour      5    # maximum number of bottles of each flavour in a vending machine
	MaxShippedPerFlavour    3    # maximum number of bottles of each flavour generated by the bottling
	                             #    plant per production run
	TimeBetweenShipments    3    # length of time between shipment pickup
	ParentalDelay           200  # length of time between new deposits of funds
	NumCouriers             1    # maximum number of couriers in the pool

  ANALYSIS

  The purpose of this test was to examine behaviour with a large amount of ParentalDelay.
  The results showed that the bottling plant, truck, and vending machines continued to
  function normally while the courier and student waited very long times for the parent
  to deposit enough money to make a withdrawal. The behaviour is as expected.

10. DATA DESCRIPTION
  The tenth attempt was run as follows: ./soda

  CONFIG FILE:
  	SodaCost                2    # Manufacturer Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) per bottle
	NumStudents             2    # number of students to create
	MaxPurchases            8    # maximum number of bottles a student purchases
	NumVendingMachines      3    # number of vending machines
	MaxStockPerFlavour      5    # maximum number of bottles of each flavour in a vending machine
	MaxShippedPerFlavour    3    # maximum number of bottles of each flavour generated by the bottling
	                             #    plant per production run
	TimeBetweenShipments    3    # length of time between shipment pickup
	ParentalDelay           2    # length of time between new deposits of funds
	NumCouriers             1000 # maximum number of couriers in the pool

  ANALYSIS

  The purpose of this test was to examine behaviour of a large amount of Couriers.
  The results showed that the couriers spent most of their time waiting for jobs and
  performing very little actual work. Everything else functioned normally.
  The behaviour is as expected.

11. DATA DESCRIPTION
  The eleventh attempt was run as follows: ./soda

  CONFIG FILE:
  	SodaCost                2    # Manufacturer Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) per bottle

	MaxShippedPerFlavour    3    # maximum number of bottles of each flavour generated by the bottling
	                             #    plant per production run
	TimeBetweenShipments    3    # length of time between shipment pickup
	ParentalDelay           2    # length of time between new deposits of funds
	NumCouriers             1    # maximum number of couriers in the pool

  ANALYSIS

  The purpose of this test was to examine behaviour of a large number of Students coupled
  with a large number of vending machines. The results showed that the bottling plant and
  truck continued to function normally. Only a couple vending machines were active at a time
  and students spent the large majority of the time busy waiting between machines and waiting
  for parent deposits. The courier had a hard time keeping up with requests and spent alot of
  time waiting for parent deposits. The behaviour is as expected.

  ANALYSIS

  This attempt was run as a stress test. The program completed after a very long
  time succesffully.

14. DATA DESCRIPTION
  The eleventh attempt was run as follows: ./soda

	ParentalDelay           200  # length of time between new deposits of funds
	NumCouriers             200  # maximum number of couriers in the pool

  ANALYSIS

  The purpose of this test was to examine behaviour of a large number of Students coupled
  with a large number of Couriers while having a large ParentalDelay. The program took a long
  time to complete because the couriers waited a ludicrous amount of time for parent deposits.
  The behaviour is as expected.

15. DATA DESCRIPTION
  The eleventh attempt was run as follows: ./soda

  CONFIG FILE:

	NumCouriers             1    # maximum number of couriers in the pool

  ANALYSIS

  The purpose of this test was to examine behaviour of a large number of Students coupled
  with having a large TimeBetweenShipments. The program took a long time to complete because
  the students spent all of their time busy waiting between vending machines waiting for soda
  shipments. The behaviour is as expected.


CONCLUSION

  Clearly, the tests cover a wide range of scenarions and a wide range of parameter values.
  These tests undoubtedly confirm the correctness of the algorithm.
